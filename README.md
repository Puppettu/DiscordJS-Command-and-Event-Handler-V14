# 🪛 Changing Some Stuff:
- in [config.json](https://github.com/Puppettu/DiscordJS-Command-and-Event-Handler-V14/config.json) file, change "BOT TOKEN" with your bot's token, if you have Mongo, then replace "DatabaseURL" with your mongoose url.
- in [slashCommands.js](https://github.com/Puppettu/DiscordJS-Command-and-Event-Handler-V14/Events/Interactions/slashCommands.js) file, change Line:21 "YOUR USER ID" with your own id, because it's the bot developer's ID. If the bot has multiple developers, then continue with: `(command.developer && interaction.user.id !== "YOUR USER ID" || command.developer && interaction.user.id !== "2ND OWNER" || command.developer && interaction.user.id !== "3RD OWNER)"`

# 🗃️ Installing Packages:
- `npm install discord.js` - Installs the Discord.JS package
- `npm install ascii-table` - Allows the console to log the events in a table
- `npm init -y`- Installs all the required packages
- `npm install glob` - Glob package (required to use Promisify)
- `npm install mongoose` - To continue using database (MONGO)

# 👾 Starting The Bot:
